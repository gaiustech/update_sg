An overcomplicated way to deal with my ADSL provider changing my IP address.
Spins up a micro instance on AWS, runs a trivial app via Docker to echo my IP
address back to me, and updates my security group to allow inbound SSH to any
subsequently created instances. It would be nicer I guess to run the container
directly...

Usage is simple, just run update_sg.sh, assuming your AWS CLI is already setup.
